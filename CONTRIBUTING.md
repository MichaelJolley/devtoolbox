# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/ps-alias.git

**All changes should be based from the `vNext` branch.**

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/michaeljolley/ps-alias/compare/) against the `vNext` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three days (and, typically, one day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Update [README](README.md) with any needed changes
* Update [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with any changes
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
